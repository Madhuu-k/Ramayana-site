      <h2>The Epic of Ramayana</h2>
      <p>The Ramayana is one of the oldest and greatest epics of Indian literature, composed by the sage Valmiki in Sanskrit, around 2,500 to 3,000 years ago. It tells the divine story of Lord Rama, the seventh avatar of Vishnu, who was born to restore righteousness (dharma) in the world. The epic follows Rama’s journey from a noble prince of Ayodhya to an exiled hero, valiant warrior, and finally the ideal king.</p>

            <h3>Bala Kanda</h3>
            <p>Bala Kanda narrates the divine origin of Lord Rama, born to King Dasharatha through a sacred yajna performed to obtain heirs. It begins with a detailed lineage of the Ikshvaku dynasty and the birth of Rama and his brothers. Guided by Sage Vishwamitra, Rama slays demons, protects sages, and breaks Lord Shiva’s bow to marry Sita. Their grand wedding concludes the Kanda as they return to Ayodhya, symbolizing the union of dharma and devotion.</p>

            <h3>Ayodhya Kanda</h3>
            <p>Ayodhya Kanda revolves around Rama's exile following Queen Kaikeyi’s demand to fulfill her boons. Rama, ever obedient, accepts exile for 14 years. Sita and Lakshmana join him in the forest. King Dasharatha dies of heartbreak, and Bharata, refusing the throne, places Rama’s sandals on it as a symbol of his rule. This Kanda is rich with themes of duty, loyalty, sacrifice, and moral integrity.</p>

            <h3>Aranya Kanda</h3>
            <p>During the forest exile, Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana encounter sages, defeat rakshasas like Khara and Dushana, and uphold dharma. Ravana’s trickery leads to Sita’s abduction after the golden deer incident. The vulture king Jatayu attempts to rescue her but is mortally wounded. This Kanda is a turning point in the epic, filled with grief, determination, and Rama’s rising wrath against evil.</p>

            <h3>Kishkindha Kanda</h3>
            <p>Rama allies with the vanara king Sugriva after helping him defeat his brother Vali. In return, Sugriva promises to help find Sita. Hanuman is introduced as a pivotal devotee and warrior. This Kanda highlights brotherhood, loyalty, and the strategic alliance that leads to Hanuman’s journey to Lanka — setting the stage for the battle to come.</p>

            <h3>Sundara Kanda</h3>
            <p>This Kanda centers on Hanuman’s heroic leap across the ocean to reach Lanka. He finds Sita in Ashoka Vatika, consoles her, and delivers Rama’s message and ring. Before returning, he destroys a part of Lanka and defeats many rakshasas. Hanuman’s unshakable devotion, wisdom, and valor make this Kanda one of the most spiritually uplifting parts of the Ramayana.</p>

            <h3>Yuddha Kanda</h3>
            <p>This final Kanda covers the epic war between Rama and Ravana. With the help of Vanaras and the Ram Setu bridge, Rama invades Lanka. Fierce battles occur, heroes rise and fall, and Ravana is ultimately slain. Sita proves her chastity through Agni Pariksha. Rama’s victory restores dharma and concludes the epic with the triumph of righteousness over evil.</p>
